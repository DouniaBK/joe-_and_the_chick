* Additional Features

* Emojis:

Emoticons are wildly used among the targeted players of this game, they can be used as their own language to convey different meanings in various scenarios. Hence, their use can add contextual or additional emotional meaning to the player and a fun upbeat game environment. As the game is set around the dating scene of a loveable character, the emojis represent what Joe is known for, his love for sandwiches, his chick magnetism and catchphrases.

* Snake ‚ñì :

    The snake a.k.a Joe body consists of three body parts, which increases in size as the score increases hense increasing the difficulty of navigation and the risk of biting itself leading to the end of the game. The snakes coordinates are continously tracked to avoid appearing on another item existing on the field and also to check for collision with another item, leading to change in score or end of the game.

* Chick üê§:

    The chick is worth the chase as it rewards 1 point but can also hurt the score if armed. The chick will appear on the field where a spot is free and conitnously reappears after being cought.

* Taser ‚ö°:

    The taser is a weapon that will appear north of the chick giving the elusion that the chick is carrying it. The snake needs to navigate to the chick without touching the taser or the score will decrease of one point. However, if the score is at 0, it will remain as so. The taser is activated and then deactivated after being cought thus it will not continously accompany the chick.

* Speed :

   The speed of the snake will increase as the score increases making it more challenging to navigate the field and catch the chick.

* Pastrami Sandwich üåØ :

    The Sandwich is a reward that will randomly appear on free coordinates in the field for Joe to give him a booster point.

* Field :

    The field is a rectangle textpad created using curses.

## Bugs
* Although executing properly within Gitpod, the command to disable the terminals cursor "curses.curs_set(0)" returns an error in the deployed version on heroku, which means that the supplied terminal implementation does not support disabling the cursor.
The cursor will therefore be visible in the deployed version of the app, while being invisible on a local or Gitpod terminal.
